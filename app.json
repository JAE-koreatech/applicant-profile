As a designer, I am constantly devising new and interesting experiences for players to interact with. For example, throughout my day if I witness a particularly interesting action being performed, or I when learn of an interesting new concept, I immediately begin thinking of the possible ways to “game-ify” that particular activity. How can I make it interesting? How can I make it different? How can I make it fun? These are all things that I am constantly thinking nearly every moment of every day.  As a child, before I can even accurately remember, I was playing games whenever I had the free time. I grew up playing whatever I could get my hands on, whether it was handheld, on a computer, board, card, console… You get it, I love games, any kind of game.  Growing up, I was always interested in a lot of different things like art, music, science, medicine… Again, you get the picture… I have always liked learning about things, and how to do things, so this made it difficult for me to narrow down exactly what I wanted to do for a career initially. I had thought about attending college to become a kinesiologist, and practice Sports Medicine. I had thought about becoming an Engineer and designing mechanical and electronic devices. Film and Theatre are major interests of mine, and I also love doing all different kinds of art and playing music… As you can see, I had a difficult decision on my hands, so I took some time to decide what exactly I wanted to do.  As a Game Designer, I am able to take my wide range of knowledge and experience and apply them in creative and artistic new ways to share a unique and fun experience with others.","Experience":[{"Job Title":"Assistant Instructor","Company":"Rescue Instruction Operations","Period":"May 2005 – Apr 2016","Years":"11 yrs","Location":"","Description":""},{"Job Title":"Contract QA Analyst","Company":"Square Enix","Period":"Oct 2014 – Dec 2014","Years":"3 mos","Location":"El Segundo, California","Description":"In this position I perform many QA duties, such as whitebox/blackbox, case, functionality, and ad hoc testing.

During 4 years at the ESEO, I have learnt both electronic and computer science skills. I chose the software engineering specialization during my last year at ESEO and continued this specialization at the Illinois Institute of Technology so that I was able to see different perspectives on different fields such as Cloud computing, testing, OS design and implementation, Software project management. Moreover, I had the opportunity at IIT to work on the Chicago Waste Water treatment Plant. This huge cyber physical system project was a real challenge : it involved working with several specialized team, each one having its own knowledge such as chemical engineering or envirnmental engineering. I ended this year at IIT with a 3.9 GPA.  Furthermore, this international experience was a way to ensure I am able to be mobile : spending one year away from my country was not only a way to improve my language, it was also a interesting and challenging experience.  My professional experience is mainly made by the job I have done to pay my studies. I have worked for 4 years as an experienced Web 2.0 and Java developper for big companies and small businesses as well, with my own company or with the ESEO \"Junior Entreprise\".

Recently I was a systems architect in a medium sized software company (900+ employees). Meanwhile, I believe that theoretical knowledge is useless without practice, so I always have enough time for hands-on programming.  I know how to build different APIs as well as making complex integrations of various products. I was a lead developer and an architect of SHM project where we managed to integrate 5+ extremely different products via centralized bus (classic ESB architecture). I was also responsible for Parallels Plesk API development where I had to support backward compatibility for 20+ API versions simultaneously. I also have an experience to work with load balancers, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud, LXC, Docker, Terraform, Ansible ZeroMQ and RabbitMQ. A couple years ago I did an experiment with 10 million(!) concurrent POST requests on a single consumer server. You can find more details in my project on GitHub  I am obsessed with cloud technologies like P2P, MapReduce, Gossip-based algorithms and distributed hash tables. I had an experience to build neural networks in 1997-2000. I also worked a bit with real time video processing. It would be great to continue working with this tech stack on a new level. I love to learn something new every day!  My principles and convictions: * Think \"Win-Win\". This world is full of wealth. It is enough for all. I am sure that it is always possible to find a way of collaboration where everyone wins. * Mistakes and failures are the excellent opportunities to learn something new. You just need to be able to accept them and to make proper conclusions. * Creativity is a myth. There are a lot of quite specific techniques how to find innovative and effective solutions.","Experience":[],"Education":[],"Skills \u0026 Endorsements":[{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""}],"":[{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""},{"Skills":"","Endorsements":""}]}

My passion for computer science and software engineering manifested early - it took me from receiving the second-highest score for CS at my school for the national year 12 exams to where I am now. Along the way I designed, developed, tested, released, marketed and supported a number of applications like DiskMax and neoSearch that earned me accolades both during my undergraduate studies and afterwards in the form of glowing editorials from sites like Download.com.  My proven and publicly visible track-record captured the kind attention of some of Wellington’s leading IT company managers and owners, particularly John Clegg (former CTO of what became eBay India). In the 3 years I was in New Zealand, I have had the good fortune of working with and learning from some really exceptional people at Microsoft, FNZ, Alcatel-Lucent, Intergen, Kiwibank, Optimal Workshop and others. My skills and world view have been strongly influenced by them and I am very grateful.  A paper detailing the research work for my Masters was accepted to the 7th IEEE e-Science conference in Sweden and my presentation there in Dec 2011 was well-received. My personal software applications have been installed over 1 million times and have hundreds of glowing reviews around the web, including one by CNET's Download.com.  I now have significant expertise in cloud computing, social applications, networks and mobile computing. I am currently at an amazing company in a role that I look forward to growing into.

I love crafting stories, building relationships and growing businesses. I'm passionate about innovation, social impact, and designing and delivering delightful customer experiences.  I specialize in: Business Development, GTM \u0026 Brand Strategy, Design Thinking, Experience Design, Project Management, Account Management, Sales Operations, Sales, Startups, Story telling, B2B  --- I started my career with a brief stint in media, as an event marketer and editorial researcher at two NYC-based publications. I then entered the world of design and creative strategy, where I was introduced to the design thinking methodology and the power of human-centered design. Over the 3 years I worked at Openbox, I got to work with some amazing socially-conscious companies and collaborate with a creative team to solve systems-level problems that matter (like: how can we make the technology industry more diverse? and how can we design the community space of the future?).  We solved these problems through projects that addressed: Brand Strategy, Experience Design, Product and Service Innovation, Organizational Transformation, Design Research, and Workshop Design \u0026 Facilitation. My role was split between business development (finding right partners and clients for our consultancy), and being an active member of our project teams (putting my project management, client service, and content strategy skills to work).  I then moved to Seattle, where I have been learning more about SaaS, technology implementation, and product development at a bootstrapped and profitable startup in the career development/ed-tech space. I am responsible for launching all things B2B at Jobscan, ranging from strategy to market development to sales and account management.

I love Computer Science and Engineering. That is why I studied Software Engineering as an undergraduate student.  Later, I found myself gravitated toward the world of Data Mining. This quotation stuck with me: \"We're drowning in data, but starving for knowledge!\" I applied and got admitted to the best university of my home country to study Data Mining, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, etc. I broke out of my comfort zone and lots of great things have happened since then. I earned my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and I ranked 1st among all Computer Engineering graduates.  As one of the novel and challenging applications of machine learning, I chose to study DNA microarrays of cancer tumors in my MS thesis. This opened the door for me to the interdisciplinary world of Bioinformatics. I applied to USC which has the oldest and one of the most reputable Computational Biology and Bioinformatics programs in the United States. I was honored to win the USC Provost's PhD Fellowship which is the most prestigious university-wide fellowship.  Shortly, I found that statistics plays a very important role in this field and to better understand and apply data analysis and machine learning algorithms, I need to better know the underlying statistical concepts. I embraced this challenge and I earned a Master’s degree in Statistics in parallel with my PhD studies on computational problems in metagenomics.  I believe I am a good team player and a quick learner. I have always developed myself to be hard-working, goal-oriented, self-motivated, and good at creative and critical thinking. Now, I am so excited and passionate to use my extensive academic training to solve real-world problems in the industry and I enthusiastically believe the upcoming challenges help me grow further and bring more value to my career.","Experience":[{"Job Title":"Company Name LinkedIn","Company":"","Period":"Jan 2019 – Present","Years":"6 mos","Location":"San Francisco Bay Area","Description":""},{"Job Title":"Company Name University of Southern California","Company":"","Period":"2015 – 2016","Years":"1 yr","Location":"","Description":"Designed and implemented an ensemble model based on Random Forest for taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA gene sequences.

Each of these data sources describe partly of the user profiles, e.g., Taobao data is mostly related to the user purchase behavior, Alipay data tells us the financial status of a specific person, etc. By combining all these data sources in a consistent way through mapping to the human IDs, we can set up the most complete and the largest user profiles corpus in the world. However, each data source can only cover partial of the whole population and the reliability, consistency, latency of the information that are contained in each data source vary quite a lot. We are in the goal of setting up a framework for mapping and connecting these close to 100 billion IDs to around 1 billion human IDs that are contained in the huge data corpus. We would like to set up a large scale hetergenous graph platform with dynamic storage, expansion and inference that can handle the most complete user profiles corpus in the world.  This is one of the most important work that we are currently working on and we also work on many other exciting projects. If you are experienced with 1.

All my work experience has revolved around data; good thing I'm no stranger to working with data. In my previous position at Google I have worked closely with spacial data correcting and adding values that impact thousands of front end users.

At Provape, I developed forecasting models that were integrated into temperature control software. I have also munged through mislabelled and poorly organized brewery and county data to produce the business analytics we ultimately incorporated into our business plan.  Throughout my post-college career, I have worked closely with data, from analyzing thermal time series to using regression techniques to forecast brewery sales, and have found it fun and interesting.
